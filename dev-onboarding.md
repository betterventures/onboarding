# Holla!
## Welcome to Better Ventures!

We're happy to have you on board!

## Values
As we serve organizations doing social good here, we try to have our processes reflect the values that we espouse to our clients. Therefore, we use tools that promote:
- transparency (Slack, Pivotal Tracker, Harvest)
- communication (Slack, Pivotal Tracker)
- collaboration (Slack, Pivotal Tracker)
- doing the Right Thing (TM).

As we strive to do the Right Thing in our own work, we strive to make it easy for everyone to do the Right Thing. That's our job to you. We find that these values help make it easy to do the Right Thing.

## Tools
As noted above, we use tools that exemplify our values of transparency, communication, and collaboration. We find that using these tools as the processes they facilitate help us to do The Right Thing. In that vein, we like:

- [Slack](www.slack.com) - For Communication. Feel free to go offline to get in the zone, but please set your status icon to such, and indicate when you might be back (2-3 hours is fine). We try to not interrupt your flow here.
- [Pivotal Tracker](www.pivotaltracker.com) - For Project Management (and other fun things, like estimation, commenting, and feedback.)
- [Harvest](www.harvestapp.com) - For Time Tracking and Invoicing (we find that knowing how much time we spend on things helps us realize where we are doing well, and where we need help to do better.)
- [Zoom.us](www.zoom.us) - For Easy Virtual Meetings. We find this is the easiest way to get everybody in a room with the least finicking over microphones and cords.

## Processes
Our processes also strive for transparency, communication, and collaboration. They allow us to do the Right Thing for ourselves and the client, while providing a space for everyone to grow and have their voice heard within the company.

- Agile Process Flow:
  - Standup: We will have a daily standup with dev and PM, either in Slack or with the client, depending on the client's preference. Standard process: yesterday, today, blockers, questions. 5m, daily.
  - IPM: We will have a weekly Iteration Planning Meeting with or without the client. Here we'll discuss the week's stories, estimate them, mark any for breakout into smaller stories, and answer questions. 1hr, weekly (usually Mondays).
  - Retro: We will have a weekly Retrospective with dev, PM, and client, either remotely or in-person if possible. This is your chance to raise any issues, things that went well, things that didn't go so well, and things that we should watch for the future. Standard Good-Meh-Bad / Keep-Watch-Change pattern. 1hr, weekly (usually Fridays).
  - Pre-IPM: PM and the client will meet once weekly, as-needed, to determine the content of next week's IPM. We'll take into account any comments or questions you have during this meeting, so feel free to make story comments or reach out to @frank directly before the meeting. This is largely dependent on the experience of the client, and our desire to smooth out the planning process so that IPM can be as efficient as possible. 1hr, weekly (usually Fridays).
- Slack Practices:
  - Turn notifications on.
  - Respond when @'ed, even if just to give a time estimate. "30m" is fine as a response.
  - Feel free to ignore chat that's not @ you.
- Slack User Guidelines:
  - **CREDO**: Everyone is in a zone, so give them a second if they don't respond immediately. Immediate response drains focus and creates a culture of reactivity.
  - If you need something from someone, feel free to reach out directly to that person. Just be aware that they may not be immediately available.
  - If someone asks you for something, respond, even if it's just to give a quick timeframe of when they can expect a response. This allows them to plan their day and keep being productive (we've all been blocked for hours and not known if someone is even there).
  - If you give a timeframe when you're going to reply, keep that timeframe. Don't cry wolf. Instead, give an honest timeframe, even if it's long. This empowers others to find alternative solutions if they need to.
  - If someone doesn't respond, feel free to reach out to Frank or your PM and he'll get you sorted. :whip:
- Health Practices:
  - If you're bored or zoning out, take a walk. It's better for you, it's better for us :).
  - If you need caffeine but it's late, try tea :). We like Pu-Erh for it's potency without being overwhelming (thanks, Tim!)

## Example Project Flow

For devs, a Better Ventures project follows a predictable flow. That flow is as follows:

1. **Client Engagement**: Contracts are signed, projects are scoped, milestones are set.
2. **Dev Engagement**: Hey! You agreed to sign on to the project!
3. **Kickoff!**: You get to meet the client in-person or over [Zoom](zoom.us), and they get to meet you. We find this is nice for making sure everyone knows each other and feels comfortable asking questions.
4. **Engagement**: We do the actual PM and dev work. This is the meat of our effort, as it should be. We have a daily standup, weekly IPM, and weekly Retro. You reach out with questions and feedback as it makes the project run more smoothly.
5. **Project Close**: Once the contract is over, we hold a meeting with the client, dev, and PM to celebrate the close of another successful project! We ask the client to say a few words, and let us know how our work will impact people. This is a chance for everybody to reflect and share stories and experiences, talk about the next project, and is generally a fun time.
6. **Project Retro!**: Once the contract is over, we hold a 1-hr Project Retro with you, the PM, and Frank. The purpose of this meeting is to surface what went well, what went not-so-well, and what we can keep and change for the next project. This can be anything from client expectations, to communication, to our process.
7. **(Optional) Dev Retro**: If you like, we can have a 1-1 retro between you and your PM once per month. This is your chance to get and give feedback, ask for professional development, and generally grow in the ways you'd like. It's an optional meeting, so if you don't like doing it, no worries. It's completely up to you. (We like when you do it, though :)).

## Management Project Flow

Finally, if you'd like to know how our management process goes down from the client's perspective, here's our Customer Project Flow:

1. **Intake**: We assess their needs and get an initial idea of their project via our [Intake Form](https://goo.gl/forms/hAMtGdzrCVaOqcsW2).
2. **Consultation**: Frank & Co. meet the prospective customer and get a better idea of what they need and what we can offer them. If they like us and it's a good fit, we do a scoping.
3. **Scoping**: We do a hi-level design sprint to come up with the major milestones (Epics) the client wants hit in the scope of their contract. They tell us the number of months they'd like to hire us for. We give them estimates of how much can get done in those months. Finally, based on this information, they tell us how many dev-hours they'd like to hire for, based on how that will help them hit their goals. We also touch on Agile and how Tracker's bottom-up estimates work, as this influences our approach and their time-to-live. Pretty cool.
4. **Signing**: If the client likes us and likes our scoping, we offer them a contract based on dev-hours, and they sign it. Half is due up front, and the rest due on delivery. The contract come with the understanding that estimates change, and we will keep them updated via Slack, Tracker, and Email as the project moves on.
5. **Kickoff!**: Project kickoff, as above. Everybody meets in person, hears about the scope of the project and the client's goals and mission (we hope it's inspiring!), and has some beers.
6. **Engagement**: The work occurs. From the client's perspective, they participate in standups, IPMs, and Retros, and hang out in the Slack channel to be as helpful as possible. We view the client as a full participant in our process.
7. **Project Close**: This is the client's chance to thank us for our work, and show us how it's going to impact people. This is generally a warm and fuzzy moment for us, and a triumphant one for them. We like to make people feel good, and feel good ourselves :). Have fun!

From the customer's side, we try to let them get to know us in Slack in in various "face-time" (Zoom) meetings, and we try to make them feel A) in control, and B) good about working with us.

We find that trust is earned and not given, and maintaining transparency, communication, and collaboration helps us earn it.
